# ðŸ“Š refineR-reference-interval

**refineR-reference-interval** is an R-based application designed to simplify the process of estimating clinical reference intervals. Developed by **[Naweed Yakubi](https://github.com/yakubinaweed)**, this tool leverages the powerful [`refineR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=refineR) package to provide an easy-to-use solution for scientists and researchers. Whether you're working with laboratory data or conducting clinical studies, this application aims to make the complex task of generating accurate reference intervals more accessible and less time-consuming.

The application supports a variety of statistical methods, including non-parametric, Box-Cox, and robust approaches, to ensure flexibility and reliability in reference interval estimation. Its goal is to help scientists quickly analyze and visualize reference intervals, saving time and effort on statistical computations.
